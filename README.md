# Dairy-Management-Database


This is a database project for the Dairy Products Management System that will help us handle dairy product operations more efficiently, such as milk collection, inventory management, supplier transactions, and orders by retailers. This approach benefits numerous stakeholders, including dairy farmers, suppliers, retailers, and customers, by streamlining record-keeping and inventory management.
The Dairy Product Management System includes major features such as product management, supplier and retailers record-keeping, inventory tracking, order administration, and basic reporting. It allows users to monitor stock levels, conduct transactions, track orders, and generate sales and inventory reports. The specific modules and their functionalities are discussed in the following sections.
